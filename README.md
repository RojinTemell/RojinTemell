## Hi there 👋

I'm Rojin Temel
I'm currently working on Cross-platform mobile applications 
with **Flutter**,
focusing on clean architecture, 
scalable state management, and high-performance UI development.

I'm currently learning **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, particularly 
how ML models can be integrated into mobile applications to build smarter 
and more personalized user experiences.

I'm looking to collaborate on Flutter-based mobile projects,
especially those involving **AI-driven features**, 
data-centric solutions, or innovative product ideas.

I'm looking for help with Best practices for
**deploying, optimizing, and maintaining ML models** in mobile environments.
Flutter, cross-platform mobile development, state management(Cubit), RESTful APIs, and applying AI concepts in mobile apps.
